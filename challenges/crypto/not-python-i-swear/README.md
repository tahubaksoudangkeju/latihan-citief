# CRYPTO Challenge: Not Python I Swear
by: TahuCryptsi

"I have homework and they told me to use Python, but I love C the most… so I mixed them (and maybe swapped some nibbles on the way)"

## Description
This is a mixed-language challenge that combines Python and C code with data manipulation. The challenge involves analyzing code that mixes programming paradigms and includes nibble swapping operations.

## Challenge Details
- **Language**: Python 3 + C (via ctypes)
- **Type**: Mixed Programming/Cryptography
- **Objective**: Analyze the mixed code execution and recover the flag
- **Key Concepts**: ctypes, dynamic linking, data transformation

## Files Provided
- `chall.py` - Main challenge script with Python/C integration
- `output.txt` - Output from the challenge execution

## Challenge Hints
- The challenge mixes Python and C programming paradigms
- Nibble swapping operations transform the data
- Analyze the ctypes usage for dynamic library calls
- Consider how data flows between Python and C components
- Use debugging tools to trace execution flow
- Apply reverse engineering techniques to understand the transformations
